    Here is the format of what you should return, make sure the answers for each question are a bit similar to throw the user offâ€”note the formatting, it is supposed to look like a Python list, so make sure the syntax works:

    ["answer (the letter) QUESTION", "a) CHOICE", "b) CHOICE", "c) CHOICE", "d) CHOICE"],
